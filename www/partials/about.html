        <h2>The Collection</h2>
        <p>In 1969, the Texas legislature voted to enact 1% for art for University of Houston. UH was the first state institution to establish a percent for art program and currently has one of the largest and most impressive university art collections in the country. Today, the collection numbers over 500 artworks located throughout the UH System campuses.</p>
        <p>With the help of the University’s System Wide Art Acquisition Committee comprised of UH Regents, UH System faculty and staff, local curators and community representatives, the collection continues to expand and include work by regional, national and international artists.</p>
